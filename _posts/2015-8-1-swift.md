I just started going through the tutorials at [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) and finding them very useful so far. Last time I looked into developing for iOS it was a few versions ago and Objective C was the only option. I found it to be quite confusing and got a bit overwhelmed by trying to learn everything at once but the process seems to have been streamlined quite a lot in the mean time.
